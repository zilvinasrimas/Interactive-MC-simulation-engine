# Interactive-MC-simulation-engine
Interactive MC simulation engine for Ising and lattice-gas models built using Qt gui tools and MathGL graphics.

In order to run the application Qt and MathGL libraries need to be installed. They are available under GPL license to download at https://www.qt.io/ and http://mathgl.sourceforge.net/doc_en/Main.html. The project file is in vpart/vpart/vpart.pro.

A detailed user manual of the application is given in Chapter 5 of the Thesis in thesis.pdf. The rest of the thesis provide a comprehensive physical description of the simulated processes.

This is a downgraded version of the application in order to increase readability and simplify the structure of the project. However, this inevitably implies that there are some unavailable features, unused variables and certain structural components of the project might seem unnecessarily complicated for the functionality that remains in this version.

The entire project was designed and produced by Zilvinas Rimas. Permission is granted to freely copy, distribute and/or modify this project.
